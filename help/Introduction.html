    <h1>Welcome to RobotBuilder</h1>


    <p><b>WARNING:</b> If this is being displayed in the lower right hand
       corner of the window, it will be replaced as soon as you click

    <h2>What is it?</h2>
    <p>RobotBuilder is an application designed to aid the robot
       development process. Robot builder can help you:</p>
    <ul>
      <li>Generating boilerplate code.</li>
      <li>Organize your robot and figure out what its key subsystems are.</li>
      <li>Check that you have enough channels for all of your sensors and actuators.</li>
      <li>Generate wiring diagrams.</li>
      <li>Easily modify your operator interface.</li>
      <li>More...</li>
    </ul>

    <h2>Getting Started</h2>
    <p>This section will take you through the basics of using
       RobotBuilder to develop a relatively simple robot. We will
       cover:</p>
    <ul>
      <li>Subsystems: The physical parts of your robot.</li>
      <li>Commands: The actions your robot can perform.</li>
      <li>Operator Interface: How your drivers interact with the robot.</li>
      <li>Generating boilerplate code.</li>
      <li>Generating wiring diagrams.</li>
    </ul>
