    <h1>Welcome to RobotBuilder</h1>


    <p><b>WARNING:</b> If this is being displayed in the lower right hand
       corner of the window, it will be replaced as soon as you click
       on a robot component, to bring up a permanent copy, click
       "Getting Started" on the toolbar.</p>
    
    <h2>What is it?</h2>
    <p>RobotBuilder is an application designed to aid the robot
       development process. Robot builder can help you:</p>
    <ul>
      <li>Generating boilerplate code.</li>
      <li>Organize your robot and figure out what its key subsystems are.</li>
      <li>Check that you have enough channels for all of your sensors and actuators.</li>
      <li>Generate wiring diagrams.</li>
      <li>Easily modify your operator interface.</li>
      <li>More...</li>
    </ul>

    <h2>Getting Started</h2>
    <p>This section will take you through the basics of using
       RobotBuilder to develop a simple robot with tank drive. We will
       cover:</p>
    <ul>
      <li>Subsystems: The physical parts of your robot.</li>
      <li>Commands: The actions your robot can perform.</li>
      <li>Operator Interface: How your drivers interact with the robot.</li>
      <li>Generating boilerplate code.</li>
      <li>Generating wiring diagrams.</li>
    </ul>

    <h3>Subsystems</h3>

    <p>Subsystems are RobotBuilders way of organizing your robot. A
       subsystem should represent a distinct part of the robot that
       performs a particular subset of tasks. For example, a Drive
       Train consists of a series of motors that drive it and maybe
       some encoders to measure it's speed and distance. For more,
       see: <a href="Subsystem.html">Subsystems</a>
       and <a href="Subsystem.html">Subsystem</a>

    <h4>Creating the Drive Train</h4>
    <p>The first step on the way to a fully functional subsystem is to
       create the subsystem, so that it exists in your robot tree.</p>
    <p>To create the Drive Train subsystem:</p>
    <ul>
      <li>Click on "Subsystem" in the palette on the left.</li>
      <li>Drag it over Subsystems in the robot tree and release.</li>
      <p>A new subystem has been created.</p>
    </ul>
    
    <h4>Naming the Drive Train</h4>
    <p>After you have a subsytem created, it is very helpful to give
       it a name.</p>
    <p>To name the subsystem:</p>
    <ul>
      <li>Click on the newly created "Subsystem 1".</li>
      <p>It's properties will appear on the right.</p>
      <li>Double click the cell to the right of name, that contains "Subsystem 1".</li>
      <li>Edit it to read "Drive Train".</li>
      <p>It's new name appears in the tree.</p>
    </ul>
    
    <h4>Adding a Robot Drive to the Drive Train</h4>
    <p>The easiest way to make your robot drive is to us the
       RobotDrive object in WPILib. It provides methods for tank
       drive, arcade drive and mechanum drive.</p>
    <p>To add a robot drive to your Drive Train:</p>
    <ul>
      <li>Click on "Robot Drive 2" in the palette on the left.</li>
      <li>Drag it over "Drive Train" in the robot tree and release.</li>
      <p>Your Drive Train now has a robot drive object.</p>
      <li>Rename it to "Robot Drive", the same way you renamed the "Drive Train".</li>
    </ul>
    
    <h4>Adding Motors to the Robot Drive</h4>
    <p>The RobotDrive object needs motors for bothi it's left and and
       it's right side.</p>
    <p>To add motors to your robot drive:</p>
    <ul>
      <li>Click on "Jaguar" in the palette on the left.</li>
      <li>Drag it over "Robot Drive" in the robot tree and release.</li>
      <li>Rename it to "Left Jaguar", the same way you renamed the "Drive Train".</li>
      <li>Click on "Jaguar" in the palette on the left.</li>
      <li>Drag it over "Robot Drive" in the robot tree and release.</li>
      <li>Rename it to "Right Jaguar", the same way you renamed the "Drive Train".</li>
    </ul>
    
    <h4>Checking That the Motors are Correctly Assigned</h4>
    <p>The RobotDrive object tries to guess which motors are which,
       but it's helpful to check that they are correctly assigned to
       the proper side.</p>
    <p>To add motors to your robot drive:</p>
    <ul>  
      <li>Click on "Robot Drive".</li>
      <li>Make sure that the "Left Motor" property is set to "Left Jaguar", if not click on it and select "Left Jaguar".</li>
      <li>Make sure that the "Right Motor" property is set to "Right Jaguar", if not click on it and select "Right Jaguar".</li>
    </ul>

    <p>You now have a subsystem representing your robots Drive Train!</p>
